HTML::Widgets::SelectLayers
===========================

This module implements an HTML widget with multiple layers.  Only one layer
is visible at any given time, controlled by a <SELECT> box.  For an example
see http://www.420.am/selectlayers/

This HTML generated by this module uses JavaScript, but nevertheless attempts
to be as cross-browser as possible, testing for features via DOM support rather
than specific browsers or versions.  It has been tested under Mozilla 0.9.8 and
1.0rc1, Netscape 4.77, IE 5.5, Konqueror 2.2.2, and Opera 5.0.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
